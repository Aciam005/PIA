**IoT Application Development: BLE Connectivity, Wi-Fi Provisioning, and REST API Integration**

* **Architecture and Connectivity:** Developed firmware in C/C++ using the Arduino environment, configuring the device (based on the ESP32 architecture) to act as a **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** server. The application enables bidirectional communication with external clients through BLE characteristics and descriptors.
* **Wi-Fi Provisioning via BLE:** Implemented a secure network configuration mechanism that processes commands over BLE to scan for available Wi-Fi networks, returning information such as SSID, signal strength (RSSI), and encryption type. The system performs dynamic connection of the device to a local network using credentials received remotely.
* **REST API Querying and HTTP Management:** Utilized the native HTTP client to perform GET requests to external REST endpoints, retrieving data structures from web servers. The implementation includes a robust algorithm for automatic handling of **HTTP redirects** (HTTP 301, 302, 303), ensuring stable data extraction even when routes change.
* **JSON Processing and Management:** Utilized the **ArduinoJson** library for efficient serialization and deserialization of data packets, managing memory allocation directly on the microcontroller. The system extracts specific data from complex API responses and restructures them into new JSON objects for user reporting.
* **Optimized Data Transmission (Chunking):** Developed a fragmentation function to sequentially transmit large JSON payloads back to the BLE client. Data is split into blocks and transmitted via successive BLE notifications, preventing packet loss and adhering to the protocol's MTU size limitations.
* **Technologies and Concepts:** C/C++, IoT (Internet of Things), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi Communications, HTTPClient, REST API, JSON Parsing.
